## Basic Overview

Snippet Index is a browsable database of code snippets/classes/functions for ideally all algorithms in computer science. 

It is accesible through the Web UI, API and IDE integrations

Current Database is crawled from [TheAlgorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python)

Communicating happens on [Discord](https://discord.gg/8m3d9Bn)

**For Beginners**

As you know its best to learn by doing.
Pick any algo you want and implement it in python over here.

To add your own Snippets/Functions/Classes to the Database,
1. Fork the repo.
2. Clone the forked version to your local machine.
3. Create a file inside ```Python/``` folder of the repo.
4. Add your code to it.
5. Push and Commit.
6. Create a Pull Request.

The code should be well documented. Follow format in [Python/snippet.py](https://github.com/omkarjc27/Snippet-Index/blob/master/Python/snippet.py)
The coding style is currently flexible,
just make sure your code is readable and well documented.


**For IDE plugin devs**

If you can create plugins for any IDE/Text-Editor.
